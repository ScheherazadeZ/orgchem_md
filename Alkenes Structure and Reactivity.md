##Alkenes (Olefins)
###1. **Definition**
>* _A hydrocarbon that contains a carbon-carbon DOUBLE bond._

###2. Industrial preparation of Alkenes:
* Thermal cracking of light ($C_2$--$C_8$) alkanes, about 850--900℃
* Favored because of the dominance of increased entropy due to increase ΔT & ΔS

###3. **_Saturation_**
* Alkenes are unsaturated while alkanes are saturated.
* If saturated: $C_(n)H_(2n+2)$
* Calculation rules:
>1. Add the numbers off **halogens** (includes F, Cl, Br, I) to the number of hydrogens.
>2. Ignore the number of **Oxygens**.
>3. Subtract the number of **nitrogens** from the number of hydrogens

###4. Nomenclature of Alkenes
>1. Find the longest C chain WITH double bond and name it.
>2. Numbering starts at the C closer to the double bond and branching point.
>3. Number the substituents accordingly, put the number of double before the parent hydrocarbon.

* vinyl group: $H_2C$=$CH$         allyl group: $H_2C$=$CH$-$CH_2$

###5. Structure & Isomerism
1. Electronic Structure:
* _π bond need to be broken for rotation._

2. Cis-Trans Isomerism
3. Sequence Rules: The E, Z Designation

###6. Stability of Alkenes
* The interconvertion between Trans and Cis can be accomplished by a **strong acid catalyst**
**The relationship between equilibrium constant & free energy**(heat of combustion; lower energy, more stable)

* Alkenes hydrogenation back to Alkanes under $H_2$ gas with catalysts
		less $ΔG°$ / $ΔH°$, more stable

* If data different:
>1. experimental error
>2. two measurements are not exactly the same

* Less substituents, less stable

* **_Hyperconjugation_**
* _A stabilizing interaction between the unfilled antibonding C=C π bond orbital and a filled C-H σ bond on a neighbouring substituent_

* The position of the double bond influences the stability due to more strength from $sp^2$ than $sp^3$

###7. Electrophilic Addition & Carbo-cation

**Mechanism**
>1. The electrophile s attacked by the π electrons of the double bond (protonation of the alkene, slow)
>2. A new C-H bond is formed
>3. Carbon atom left with a + charge and a vacant p orbital (Carbon-cation intermediate)
>4. The R of the electrophile donates an electron to the positively charged carbon atom (fast)
>5. A C-R σ bond is formed
>6. The neutral product is yielded (Exergonic)

**Orientation**
>**_Regiospecific_**: 
>	When only one of two possible orientation of addition occurs in a reaction
>
>**_Markovnikov's rule_**:
>	In electrophilic addition, the proton (H+) attaches to the carbon with fewer alkyl substituents and the R attaches to the one with more alkyl substituents
>	When same, a mixture of addition products result
>	(Restated with carbon-cation intermediate) In the addition of HR to an alkene, the more highly substituted carbon-cation is formed as the intermediate rather than the less highly substituted one.

**Carbon-cation**

> Structure:_ planar, $sp^2$-hybridized, substituents are oriented to the corners of an equilateral triangle, vacant p orbital below and above the planar.

_Stability:_ more highly substituted, more stable, less disassociation enthalpy per mol.
>1. Inductive effect: electrons from a relatively large and polarizable alkyl group can shift toward a neighboring positive charge more easily than the electron from a hydrogen.
>2. Hyperconjugation: more alkyl groups, more possibilities for hyperconjugation, more stable.

**The Hammond Postulate**
>_The structure of a transition state resembles the structure of the nearest stabl especies. Endergenic: closer to products; Exergonic: closer to reactants_
>* More stable carbon-cations form faster because their stability is reflected in the transition state leading to them
>* Imagined structure of alkene re-hybridized from $sp^2$ to $sp^3$ during transition state, the left carbon positively charged and stabilized by inductive effect and hyper-conjugation.

**Carbon-cat-ion Rearrangement**
>**_Hydride shift_**
>The shift of a hydrogen atom (alkyl group) and its electron pair between neighboring carbons from a less stable structure to a more stable one.
