## Thermochemistry

### 1. Energy
1. Kinetic Energy
2. Potential Energy
3. Thermal Energy
4. **Chemical Energy:** _Asociated with Positions of Electrons and Nuclei_

>**Formula:**
>$KE=1/2mv^2$
>$1kg  m^2 / s^2 = 1j$
>$1J = 4.18 cal$
>$E= w + q$
>$q= C_smΔT$
>$w=F * D=P*A*D=PΔV$
>$q_cal = C_cal * Δ T$  constant volume calorimetry

###2. **Enthalpy**
* **Definition:**_the sum of its internal energy and the product of its pressure and volume_
	 	$H_(reaction)$also called as **Heat of Reaction**, a measure of the change in total bonding energy during a reaction
* $ΔH(enthalpy) = ΔE + PΔV$ state function
* At constant $P​$, $ΔH = ΔE​$

###3. **_Hess's Law_**
* **Definition:** _If a chemical equation can be expressed as the sum of a series of steps, then $ΔH_r$ for the overall equation is the sum of the heats of reactions for each step._


###4. **_Standards for Thermochemistry_**
>1. **Standard state:**
>	_Gas:_ Pure gas at exactly 1 atmosphere
>	_Liquid/Solid:_ Pure substance, most stable form, at 1 atm, and temperature of interest (usually 25℃)
>	_Substance in Solution:_ Concentration of exactly 1 M
>2. **Standard Enthalpy Change (ΔH°)**
>	When all reactants and products are in standard state,
>3. **Standard Enthalpy (Heat) of Formation($ΔH°_f$)**
>	_Pure Compound:_ 1 mole of compounds forms from its constituents elements in their standard states.
>	_Pure Element:_ $ΔH°_f = 0$ ("sea level")

* **_Rule of Calculation:_**
	 	To calculate Standard Enthalpy Change of a reaction, substract _the sum of enthalpies of formation of the reactants_, multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficients, from _the sum of enthalpies of formation of the products_, multipied by their stoichiometric coefficients.
