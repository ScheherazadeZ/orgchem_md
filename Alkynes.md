## Alkynes

### 1. **Definition**:
>* _A hydrocarbon that contains a C-C triple bond._
>* e.g. Acetylene, the simplest one, used in preparation of acrylic polymers, prepared industrially by 1200℃ decomposition (pyrolysis) of methane

---------------------------------------------------------------

###2. **Electronic Structure**:
* One sp-sp σ bond + Two p-p π bonds, 180°
* 120pm length, 835kJ/mol strength.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

###3. **Nomenclature**:
* Triple bond receives number as low as possible, position indicated by the number of first alkyne
* suffix -yne; if both double and triple bond, suffix -enynes, start nearer to multibond, double lower than triple

------------------------------------------------------------------

###4. **Reactions of Alkynes**:

1. Preparation of Alkynes----Elimination of Dihalides
* Treatment of a 1,2-dihaloalkane (a vicinal dihalide, or sometimes vinylic halide intermediates) with exccesive strong base: twofold elimination of HR and formation of an alkyne.

2. Addition of HR and $R_2$
* Electrophilic addition, exccesive HR leads to a dihalide product, follow Markovnikov's rule, trans stereochemistry commonly found
* vinylic carbo-cat-ion as intermediate, sp-hybridized carbon, less readily than an alkyl carbo-cat-ion: a secondary vinylic, a primary alkyl carbo-cat-ion.

3. Hydration of Alkynes
* **Direct Mercury(II, as Lewis acid)-catalyzed, Markovnikov product**
  * Product usually not vinylic alcohol (enol), but instead a ketone
  * Enol as intermediate, keto-enol tautomerism (rearrangement)
  * Enol and Ketone----tautomers, structural isomers that interconvert rapidly
  * Internal alkyne, Mixture of possible ketone; termial alkyne, a methyl ketone
>1. Alkyne $2e^-$ attackes mercury(II) ion
>2. Vinylic carbo-cat-ion as Intermediate
>3. Nucleophilic attack of water, forms C-O bond
>4. A protonated mercury-containing enol
>5. Abstraction of $H^+$, forms an organomercury compound
>6. Replacement of $Hg^+$ by $H^+$, neutral enol
>7. Tautomerization of the structure, ketone product

* Indirect hydroboration/oxidation, non-Markovnikov product
  * Internal----ketone, terminal----aldehyde
  * if relatively unhindered terminal alkyne, two additions, doubly hydroborated intermediate
  * Oxidation at pH 8 replaces both boron atoms by oxygen and generates aldehyde
  * Complementary to the direct one

4. Reduction of Alkynes
  1. Easily reduced by addition of $H_2$ over a metal catalyst
  * Two steps to alkane, first step to alkene larger $ΔH°_(hydrogen)$ than second step
  * Pelladium on Carbon (Pd/C): Complete reduction
  * Lindlar catalyst (finely divided pellaidum precipated onto a calcium carbonate support, deactivated by lead acetate and quinoline): less reactive, stop at alkene, syn stereochemistry
  * Used in commercial synthesis of vitamin A

  2. Use sodium or Lithium metal as reducing agent in liquid ammonia as solvent\
  *  Produces trans product
  *  Anion radical, strong base, remove proton from ammonia
>1. Lithium metal donates an electron to the alkyne
>2. Give an anion radical
>3. Anion radical abstracts a proton from ammonia solvent
>4. Yields a vinylic radical
>5. Vinylic radical accepts another electron from a second lithium atom
>6. Vinylic anion abstracts another proton from ammonia solvent
>7. Final: trans alkene product

5. Oxidative Cleavage of Alkynes
  * Internal product: carboxylic acid
  * Terminal product: carboxylic acid and carbon dioxide
  * Used historically in the structure determination of substances isolated from natural sources

6. Alkyne Acidity: Formation of Acetylide Anions
  * Termincal alkyne: relatively acidic
  * When treated with strong base, terminal hydrogen removed, forming an acetylide anion
  * acetylene $pK_a$ = 25; methane 60; ethylene 44
  * Acetylene can be deprotonated by the conjugate base of any acid whose $pK_a$ is greater
  * The conjugate base of ammonia ($pK_a = 35$) is commonly used
  * alkyl anion, $sp^3$, vinylic anion $sp^2$, acetylide anioin $sp$, less hybridization, more s orbital character, more stable

7. Alkylation of Acetylide Anions
  * Nucleophilic acetylide anion reacts with an alkyl halide to substitute for the halogen and yield a new alkyne product
  * Using the electron pair to bond to the positively polarized electrophilic carbon atom of alkyl halide.
  * Any terminal alkyne can be converted into anion and then alkylated by such treatment, yielding an internal alkyne
  * Best method for preparing a substituted alkyne
  * Acetylide ion alkylation limited to primary alkyl bromides and alkyl iodides because acetylide ion is a sufficiently strong base to cause dehydrohalogenation instead of substitution when react with secondary & tertiary alkyl halides
