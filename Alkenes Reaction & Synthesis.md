## Alkenes (Olefins)

### 1. **Elimination Reactions**
1. Dehydrohalogenation:_The loss of HR from an alkyl halide_
		Often carried out by alkyl halide + strong base
2. Dehydration:_The loss of water from an alcohol_
		Often carried out by alcohol + strong acid

---------------------------------------------------------


###2. **Addition to Alkenes**
* **Halogens**
>  1. Bromine
>  	* 1,2-dihalides yielded readily
>  	* On cycloalkene, only traas product isomer yielded
>  	* **Anti stereochemistry**: two Bromine atoms come from opposite face of the double bond.
>  		_Intermediate_: bromonium ion $R_2Br^+$ instead of carbon-cat-ion (this is similar for $R_2Cl^+$)
>  		Result: large Br may shield on side of the molecule, prevent cis product
>  	
>  2. Chlorine
>  	* Industry: $Cl_2$ addition to ethylene, 1,2-dichloroethane as solvent and starting material for manufacture of polyvinyl chloride, PVC
>  	
>  3. Fluorine
>   * Too reactive to control
>  
>  4. Iodine
>   * Does not react with most alkenes


  * _Halohydrin Formation:_
>* HO-halo under suitable conditions to yield 1,2-halo alcohols, called halohydrins
>* _The intermediate(e.g. Bromonium ion) intercepted by the added competing nucleophile instead of $Br^+$ yielding different product(e.g. bromohydrin); the net effect is adding HO-Br to the alkene_
>* In practice, few alkenes soluble in water, often carried out in solvent e.g. aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide, using a reagent called N-bromosuccinimide, stably decomposing in water to yield $Br_2$, as a source of $Br_2$

---------------------------

* **Water----Hydration**
> Alkene + water + strong acid catalyst, high temperature, yields alcohol, suitable for large **industrial** manufacture instead of lab
> 1. Carbon-cat-ion intermediate, by alkenes + acid
> 2. Water as nucleophile, lone pair of electrons on oxygen, bond to carbon
> 3. Trivalent Oxygen with positive charge
> 4. Loss of $H^+$ form oxygen, yields neutral alcohol product
> 5. Regenerates acid catalyst

* **Oxymercuration** (Lab)
  * _Alkene + mercury(II) acetate $[Hg(O_2CCH_3)_2]$ + tetrahydrofuran(aq) solvent + sodium borohydride $NaBH_4$_
  * closely analogous to halohydrin formation
> 1. Electrophilic addition of Hg acetate to an Alkene
> 2. Organ-mercury intermediate, three-membered mercurinium ion
> 3. Water as nucleophile displaces mercury by back-side attack at the more highly substituted carbon (Markovnikov's postulate), breaking the C-Hg bond
> 4. Loss of $H^+$ yields a neutral organomercury addition product
> 5. organ-mercury, treated with sodium borohydride $NaBH_4$, replace the -Hg by -H
> 6. Reduce Hg, yielding an alcohol product


* **Hydroboration**
  * Involved addition of a B-H bond of borane, $BH_3$, to an alkene to yield an oranoborane intermediate, $RBH_2$
  * Borane, highly reactive, only 6 valent electrons, accepts an electron pair from solvent in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution in a Lewis acid-base reaction, forming $BH_3-THF$ complex.
  * Alkene + THF + $BH_3$, trialkylborane formed, e.g. Tricyclohexylborane (treated with $H_2O_2$, forms Cyclohexanol);  Net effect: hydration of the alkene double bond
  * **Syn stereochemistry**: the regiochemistry resulted as an unsymmetrical alkene hydroborated, making hydroboration useful for complementary to Markovnikov's; e.g. boron attached to a less substituted carbon, replaced by OH with the same stereochemistry, non-Markovnikov addition
  * Single step without carbon-cat-ion intermediate, syn because C-H & C-B bonds form at the same time
> 1. Addition of Borone to the alkene π bond, single step
> 2. A cyclic four-membered-ring transition state
> 3. A neutral alkylborane addition product is formed.

  * Borone polar character, electrophilic, Lewis acid with 6 valence $e^-$, partially negative complementary to the partial positive carbon in alkene; adding to form the more stable tertiary one, boron on less highly substituted one
  * No steric crowding, determines the regiochemistry

------------------------

* **Carbenes**
  * Carbene, $R_2C$, a neutral molecule containing a divalent carbon with only six electrons in its valence shell, highly reactive, generated only as a reaction intermediate, non-isolable, electrophilic, single step reaction with C=C without intermediate.
  * Alkene + Carbene yields Cyclo-propane.
  * _Substituted Carbene generation using chloroform $CHCl_3$_, $sp^2$-hybridized, similar to carbo-cat-ion.
>1. Strong base abstracts the chloroform proton
>2. Electron pair from C-H bond left behind
>3. Trichloromethanide formed
>4. Loss of a chloride ion & associated electrons from the C-Cl bonds
>5. Neutral dichlorocarbene yielded.

  * Dichlorocarbene generated at the precense of alkene, stereo specific (cis to cis, trans to trans) addition to alkenes
  * **Simmons-Smith reaction**: utilizes a carbenoid (a metal-complexed reagent with carbene-like activity)
>1. Diiodomethane trated with carefuly prepared zinc-copper alloy
>2. (iodomethyl)zinc iodide, $ICH_2ZnI$, formed
>3. (iodomethyl)zinc iodide transfers $CH_2$ group to the double bond
>4. Cyclo-propane yielded

  * Carbene addition to an alkene is an example of a general class of reactions: **cycloadditions**

-----------------
* Biological
  * aq medium inside cell instead of organic solvent
  * Involves enzymes
  * Much more chemically selective

----------
* **Radicals**

  * Simple alkenes undergo polymerization when treated with a small amount of radicals as catalyst
  * Addition of a radical to the double bond, similar to electrophilic addition
  * Substituted ethylenes, called vinyl monomers
  * When unsymmetrically substituted vinyl monomer is polymerized, the radical addition steps can take place at the end of =,yield either a primary radical intermediate ($RCH_2$) or a secondary radical ($R_2CH), only the secondary with more high substitution formed.
>1. **Initiation:**A few radicals are generated by the catalyst
>2. **Propagation:**The radicals formed beforeadd to another moleculeto yield different radicals; Repetition of this process
>3. **Termination:**The chain process eventually ended by a reaction that consumes the radical

  * Chain Branching during polymerization
    * Branches arise when the radical end of a growing chain abstracts a hydrogen atom from the middle of the chain to yield an internal radical site that continues the polymerization.
    * Short-chain branching, most common, position four carbon atoms away from the chain end, 50 times more often than long-chain branching
    * Long-chain branching, end of one + middle of another

  * Cat-ionic Polymerization
    * A cat-ionic initiator
    * Occurs by a chain-reaction pathway
    * Requires the use of a strong proic or Lewis acid catalyst
    * Electrophilic addition of a carbo-cat-ion intermediate to the C=C of another monomer
    * Most effective when a stable, tertiary carbo-cat-ion intermediate involves

--------------------------------------
###3. **Reduction of Alkenes**
* Hydrogenation
  * A reduction in organic chemistry oftern forms C-H bonds
  * Platinum ($PtO_2$, "Adams' catalyst") & Palladium (a very fine powder on an inert material to maximize surface area) as cataclysts
  * Heterogenous process, taking place on the surface of insoluable catalyst particles
  * Usually syn stereochemistry because both hydrogens added from the same surface
  * Extremely sensitive to the steric environment around the double bond, only approaching the more accesible side of alkene, single product
  * Useful in food industry saturating unsturated fat
>1. Absorption of $H_2$ onto the catalyst surface
>2. Complexation between catalyst and alkene occurs as a vacant orbitals on the metal interacts with the filled alkene π orbital
>3. Insertion of hydrogen into C-C double bond
>4. Saturated product diffuses away from the catalyst

---------------------------------------
###4. **Oxidation of Alkenes----Hydroxylation & Cleavage**
1. _Hydroxylation_
  * The addition of an -OH group to each of the two C
  * Can be carried out by reaction of the alkene with osmium tetroxide $OsO_4$
  * Syn stereochemistry
  * Yields 1 1,2-dialcohol, or diol (glycol) product
  * Does not involve a carbo-cat-ion intermediate, but occurs through an intermediate cyclic osmate by single step addition of $OsO_4$ to alkene, cleaved in second separate step using sodium bisulfite (aq) $NaHSO_3$.

2. _Alkene Cleavage_
  * Double bond cleavage agent, e.g. Ozone
  * Intermediate _molozonide_, rapidly rearranged to form an **ozonide**
  * Ozonide immediately treated with a reducing agent, e.g. zinc, to carbonyl compounds
  * Net result of ozonolysis/reduction sequence: C=C cleaved, O doubly bonded to C
  * If alkene with tetrasubstituted double bond, ketone + aldehyde
  * Possible agents: potassium permanganate ($KMnO_4$ in neutral/acidic solution), low/moderate yield; if H on =, carboxylic acids; if 2H & C, ￥CO_2$.

3. _1,2-Diol Cleavage
  * Cleaved by reaction with periodic acid ($HIO_4$), yield carbonyl compounds, similar to that of $KMnO_4$
  * Open chain: 2 carbonyl compounds
  * Ring: open-chain dicarbonyl compounds
  * Intermediate: Cyclic periodate
