## Overview of Organic Chemical Reaction

### 1. Kinds of Organic Reactions

1. **Addition Reaction**
2. **Elimination Reaction**
3. **Substitution Reaction**
4. **Rearrangment Reaction:**
	* _The reaction in which a single reactant undergoes a reorganization of bonds and atoms and yields an isomeric product._

>|(Free) Radical|Polar|
>|:-------------:|:-------------:|
>|Homolytic|Heterolytic|
>|One electron stays with each fragment|Two electrons stay with one fragment|
>|Homogenic|Heterogenic|
>|One electron donated by each fragment|Two electrons donated by one fragment|
>* Arrows: half-headed----single electron movement; full-headed----electron pair movement

* Bond:
	* Breaking : **Homolytic** & **Heterolytic**
	* Making : **Homogenic** & **Heterogenic**


* Electron movement:

	* Symmetrical: **Radical Reaction**
		>**Radical** (also called "_Free Radical_") is a neutral chemical species that contains an **odd** number----a **single, unpaired** electron in one of its orbitals----and as a result, highly reactive.
		
		* Radical Substitution Reaction: e.g. methane chlorination
		>Steps
		>1. Initiation: _Producing a small number of reactive radicals. e.g. Chlorine gas into two reactive chlorine radicals_
		>2. Propagation: _e.g a chain reaction: a reactive chlorine radical + methane molecule yields  hydrochloric acid and a methyl radical; the methyl radicals + chlorine gas yields a new chlorine radical and chloromethane. _
		>3. Termination: _When two radicals collide and combine to form a stable product, the cycle in propagation is broken and the chain is ended. Infrequent event because the small concentration of radicals._

	* Unsymmetrical: **Polar Reaction**
		* **Cause:** the attraction between positive and negative charges on different functional groups in molecules. _In organic chemistry,_ the polar covalent bond resulted from the imbalance of electronegativity is the main cause.

		* **Influential factors:**
			1. Functional groups interaction
			2. **Polarizability:**
				The measure of ability to change the electric field and the electron distribution around a given atom in response to the changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules. (Larger atoms, more loosely held electrons, more polarizable)
				
			|Electrophile|Nucleophile|
			|:--------:|:------------:|:---------:|
			|electron rich, looking for nucleus, negatively charged|electron poor, looking for electrons, positively charged/neutral|
			
		e.g. Addition of HBr to Ethylene
		* **Carbocation:** a carbon-cation, an electrophile.
		* _All polar reactions take place between an electron-poor site and an electron-rich site and involve the donation of an electron pair from a molecule from a nucleophile to an electrophile._
		
		* The usage of arrow:
			1. Electrons move from a nucleophile source (Nu:) to an electrophilic sink(E).
			2. The nucleophile can be either negatively charged or neutral.
			3. The electrophile can be either positively charged or neutral
			4. The octet rule must be followed.

### 3. Describing a Reaction:

1. **Gibbs free-energy change (ΔG):**
    _The energy change occurs during a chemical reaction._
    
>|Favorable reaction|Unfavorable Reaction|
>|:----------------------:|:-------------------------:|
>|exergonic|endergenic|
>|negative ΔG|positiveΔG|
>|from system to surrounding| from surrounding to system|

* $ΔG=ΔH (Enthalpy) -TΔS (Entropy)$

>|exothermic|endothermic|
>|:----------------------:|:-------------------------:|
>|negative ΔH|positiveΔH|
>|from system to surrounding| from surrounding to system|

2. **Bond Disassociation Energy:**
	 	_the amount of energy required to break a given bond to produce two radical fragments when the molecule is in the gas phase at 25℃._
	 	**Solvation:** _Solvent molecules can surround and interact with dissolved reactants (solute)._

3. **Reaction Energy Diagram**

|X-axis|Y-axis(reaction coordinate)|
|:------:|:------:|
|Total Energy of Reaction|The progress of the reaction from beginning to end|

4. **Transition State:**
	_The Highest-energy structure involved in the step of the reaction. Unstable and cannot be isolated_ (imagine to be an activated complex of the two reactants in which the C-C π bond is partially broken and the new C-H bond is partially formed)
* **Activation Energy ($ΔG^*$):**
* _The energy difference between reactants and transition state_

5. **Intermediates:**
	_The carbo-cation, which exists only transiently during the course of the multistep reaction, a reaction intermediate_
