## Stereochemistry
###1. Enantiomers and the Tetrahedral Carbon

**_Enantionmer:_**
>_Mirror-image molecules that are __NOT__ superimposible_
>__E.g.__  (+) (-) lactic acid

**_Chirality:_**
>* _The geometric property of molecules, such as enantiomers, that makes these molecules non-superimposable with their mirror-image_
>
>**Cause:**
>The precense of a carbon atom bonded to four different groups
>
>**Chirality Center:**
>Also referred as _"asymmetric center" or "stereo-genic center"_, a structural feature within the molecule that causes chirality.
>
>**Achiral:**
>* A molecule is not chiral if it contains a _plane of symmetry_ 


###2. A brief review of isomerism

>* ####Constitutional isomers
>
>|Subtypes|Examples|
>|:-------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
>|Different carbon skeletons|straight **Versus** branched|
>|Different functional groups|alcohol **Versus** ether|
>|Different position of functional groups|Isopropyl amine **Versus** Propyl amine|

###3. Sequence Rules: The _E,Z_ Designation

**_E,Z_ System of Nomenclature**
	_A set of  **Sequence rules** used to assign priorities to the substituent groups on the double bond carbons_

>**_Z_**: Germen _"suzammen"_ meaning "together"
>	Designated to the alkene when the high-priority groups on each carbon are on the same side.
>
>**_E_**: Germen _"entgegen"_ meaning "opposite"
>	.....on the opposite side.

**_Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules:_**
>	1. Considering the double-bond carbons separately, look at the two atom directly attached to and rank then according to atomic number.
>	
>	2. If a decision can't be reached by ranking the first atoms in the substituent, look at the second, third, or fourth atoms away from the double bond carbons until the first difference is found.
>	
>	3. Multiple-bonded atoms are equivalent to the same number of single-bonded atoms.

###4. Chirality at Atoms Other Than Carbon

>* Tetrahedral atoms other than carbon such as _silicon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur_ can also be chirality center.
>* _In principle,_ trivalent nitrogen is chiral, but _in practice,_ trivalent nitrogen structure undergoes a rapid umbrella-like inversion that interconverts enantiomers so we cannot isolate individual enantiomers except in special cases.
>* In the case of phosphine (trivalent phosphorus compounds),  stable chiral phosphorus can be separated because of slower inversion speed. e.g. _R_ and _S_ methyl-propyl-phenyl-phosphine.

###5. Prochirality
* **Definition:** The property of a molecule making it convertible from achiral to chiral in a single chemical step.

>**_R configuration_**: When looking at a molecule using Newmen projection, the arrow from higher-priority group to the lower one is clockwise.
>**_S configuration_**: ......counter-clockwise.
>**_re face_**: In a prochiral molecule, the face of the plane which the arrow from higher-priority group to the lower one is clockwise
>**_si face_**: ......counter-clockwise

>**_Prochirality Center:_** The atom that will become the chiral center.
>
>For identical atoms/groups on the same prochirality center:
>**_pro-R:_** when replaced, leads to R chirality.
>**_pro-S:_** ......S chirality.
